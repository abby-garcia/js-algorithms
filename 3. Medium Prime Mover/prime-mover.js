Using the JavaScript language, have the function PrimeMover(num) 
return the numth prime number. The range will be from 1 to 10^4. 
For example: if num is 16 the output should be 53 as 53 is the 16th prime number. 




function PrimeMover(num) {
	var primes = 0;

	for(var i = 2; i < 10000;i++){

		
	}

	if(num === 1){
		continue;
	}





}


PrimeMover(num);

//when it is a prime number, brint up the counter
//you have to say
